# Task1

## 1.a)Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event? b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service (of a single service point)?

- a) That is because an arrival events need to trigger next arrival events,in order to keep simulation keep running. Like simulate real life events, customer will keep coming.
  And it is easy to schedule next arrival, since arrival event usually doing 2 things, handle current arrival and schedule next arrival.
- b) at the start of the service, need to schedule a future completion B phase event at timeNow + serviceTime. In 3 phase method, the start service is a C event that start service and schedule the matching completion B event.
