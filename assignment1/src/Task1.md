# There are several examples suitable for simulation when thinking about everyday situations.
## 1. The first is the Helsinki parking system: 
- **Key Components**: Transport, Parking zones, street parking, real-time availability tracking, and more. 
- **Goal**: Proper optimize space usage,and simulate peak-hour scenarios.
- **Some Data**: Number of parking spots.
## 2. Secondly, there could be Helsinki airport simulation that includes:
- **Key Components**: Flight schedules, passenger check-in, passenger queues, passenger baggages, and aircraft turnaround.
- **Goal**: Proper optimize aircraft turnaround, passenger check-in, Flight schedules, and simulate peak-hour scenarios.
- **Some Data**:Daily flights, and customer flows.
## 3. Another idea is Helsinki traffic simulation:
- **traffic lights**
- **transportation**
- *people*
- **Key Components**: Road networks, signal timings, vehicles (cars, public transport), and people.
- **Goal**: reduce congestion with proper optimize, and implement smart traffic controls.
- **Some Data**: Road intersection data, vehicles, number of peoples.
