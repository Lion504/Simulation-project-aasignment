## Task4

## Distributions Example

### Poisson Distribution

- times you pick up your phone in different time at one day,
- the frequency you go to supermarket per week
- Usage in simulation: Flight departure and arrive in one day, passengers arrive airport in one day

### Exponential Distribution

- time you stay on 1 short video
- Usage in simulation: airport security check times, intervals between events

### Binomial Distribution

- toss coin
- Usage in simulation: Success/failure process, like passenger security check pass/fail, airplane departure and arrive on time or delay.

### Geometric Distributions

- gambling games until first win type, most of the game does.
- Usage in simulation: until security guard fine first suspicious passenger then that security gate queue will delay.
